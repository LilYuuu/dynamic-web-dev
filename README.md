### How to set up and run the application
Go to https://dynamic-web-dev-week1.glitch.me and you will see it live!

### How I built the HTML page
Tool: VS Code

### Inspiration & Process
For this assignment, I played with CSS-based interactions and animations.

The [reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucssfp9UXZg) that I found was for a smoke text effect on mouse hover. I followed through the tutorial but ended up only keeping the light shadow part. I created an interaction where the user needs to find the hidden text in the darkness with their mouse. When being hovered over, the text will then reveal itself.

### How I deployed with Glitch
1. Log in with my Github account.
2. Create a new project.
3. Choose "import from Github".
4. Enter the link to the github repo.
